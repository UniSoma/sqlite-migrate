# Knot JSON protocol

Every `knot` command that accepts `--json` emits the same tagged envelope on stdout. This document is the canonical
reference for the shape of that envelope, the per-command `data` payloads, the error and check-code catalogues, and
the partial-id contract.

The runtime is the source of truth: if this document and a live `--json` envelope ever disagree, trust the CLI and
surface the drift.

## Envelope shape

```
{"schema_version": 1, "ok": true,  "data":  <payload>, "meta"?: {...}}
{"schema_version": 1, "ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", ...}}
```

| Key              | Type    | Notes                                                                                   |
|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `schema_version` | integer | Always `1`. Bumps only on shape-incompatible changes; new keys are additive.             |
| `ok`             | boolean | Success discriminator — see *The `ok` discriminator* for the one carve-out (`knot check`). |
| `data`           | varies  | Present on success. Shape depends on the command — see *Per-command `data`*.            |
| `error`          | object  | Present on failure. Always carries `code` and `message`; some codes carry extra fields.  |
| `meta`           | object  | Optional; today only `meta.archived_to` — see *The `meta` slot*.                        |

Stable invariants:

- `schema_version` is the first key in serialized output.
- `data` and `error` are mutually exclusive — except for the `knot check` carve-out below.
- `meta` is omitted unless the command has metadata to emit; absence is "no metadata", not an error.
- All keys inside the envelope and inside `data` are `snake_case`.
- On-disk YAML key order is preserved through to JSON ticket payloads, so consumers can rely on stable diffs.
- Stdout carries the envelope only. Warnings and human-readable context go to stderr.

### The `ok` discriminator

`ok` mirrors *the outcome of the request*, not "did the command run". `knot check` is the one exception: its `ok` is
a *health verdict* on the project, so `knot check --json` on a project with integrity errors emits `ok: false`
co-emitted with `data`:

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "ok": false, "data": {"issues": [...], "scanned": {...}}}
```

The plain rule (`ok: false` ↔ `error` slot, no `data`) still holds for `check`'s *cannot-scan* exit-2 case
(`no_project` / `config_invalid`).

### The `meta` slot

`meta.archived_to` is a **location report, not a movement event**. It asserts "this ticket is in the archive, here",
so it is emitted whenever the resulting `data.status` is in the project's `:terminal-statuses`, whether or not the call
moved a file — `close` always; `status <id> <terminal>`; `update --status <terminal>`; and a field-only
`update <archived-id> --priority 1`, which lands on a terminal status without moving anything. Two calls that leave the
ticket in the same state emit the same envelope.

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "ok": true, "data": {...}, "meta": {"archived_to": "/home/you/acme/.tickets/archive/kno-01abc--shipped.md"}}
```

**An absent `meta` means the ticket is in the live directory.** The un-archiving direction is deliberately silent —
`reopen`, `status <id> <non-terminal>`, and `update --status <non-terminal>` move the file back and report nothing,
because a non-terminal `data.status` already carries that fact; there is no `restored_to`. Non-transition mutations
omit `meta` regardless of status.

## Path fields

Knot addresses tickets by **id** and locates files by **path**, and never uses one for the other job. The id is the
portable identifier — stable across retitles, closes, machines, and clones, and the only thing any command accepts; no
command takes a path argument. A path is a machine-local *locator*, emitted so a consumer can open the file now. A
consumer that wants portability stores the id.

Every path in the envelope is **absolute** and **POSIX-separated** (forward slashes on every platform, Windows
included). Absolute because the project root is discovered by walking up from cwd, so a root-relative path is not
openable from a subdirectory — terminal hyperlinking and agent file-read tools both resolve against cwd — and because
an agent then never has to join against `project_root` with a second `knot info --json` call. The one exception is
`info`'s `paths.tickets_dir`, which echoes the configured directory name (`.tickets`) and stays relative: it names a
config value rather than locating a file, and `tickets_path` is its absolute form.

| Site                 | Emitted by                                             | Notes                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `meta.archived_to`   | `close`, terminal `status`, terminal `update --status` |                                           |
| `data.deleted.path`  | `delete`                                               | Where the file *was* — it is gone.        |
| `data.paths.*`       | `info`                                                 | `tickets_dir` is the relative exception.  |
| `data.issues[].path` | `check`, on file-level codes only                      | See *`check` shape*.                      |

**Known boundary:** an absolute path is wrong across a container boundary where the repo is mounted at a different
path than the host sees. Knot does not work around this — it is the limitation every path-reporting tool carries.
Consumers crossing such a boundary key off ids and rebuild paths themselves.

## Schema versioning

`schema_version` changes only on *shape-incompatible* breaks — renaming `data`, moving `error.code`. Additive changes
(a new top-level key, a new field inside `data`, a new error or check code, a new optional field on an existing error)
do not bump it. So consumers **tolerate unknown keys**, and branch on `schema_version` only when reading a
known-incompatible field. `knot --version` is the binary version (semver), not the schema version; one binary speaks
one schema version.

## Partial-id contract

Every command that takes a ticket id accepts a partial — typically the first 6–8 characters of the suffix. Resolution
walks both live (`.tickets/`) and archive (`.tickets/archive/`), so closed tickets are always reachable. Two modes:

| Mode                 | Behavior on >1 match                                                                      | Where it applies                                                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strict** (default) | `ambiguous_id` envelope with `error.candidates: [<full-id>…]`; exit 1.                    | All read commands; `from` side of every mutation; `link` both sides; `unlink` from.     |
| **Soft**             | Resolves to the first match if unique; a literal that doesn't resolve persists verbatim.  | `dep` / `undep` `to` side; `unlink` `to` side.                                          |

Soft resolution lets an agent undo a previously broken `:deps` / `:links` ref by typing it verbatim — without it,
fixing a corrupted graph would require hand-editing.

`dep tree --json` has its own asymmetry: an unknown root id emits `{ok: true, data: {id, missing: true}}` rather than a
`not_found` error, so consumers can discover broken `:deps` refs *via* the parent that links to them. Branch on
`data.missing` distinctly from `ok: false`.

## Error codes

Every `--json` failure carries `error.code`; `error.message` is always present, human-readable, and for `not_found`
includes the missing id verbatim.

| Code                    | Trigger                                                                                         | Extra fields                 | Commands                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `not_found`             | Strict-resolved id matched no ticket (live or archive).                                         | —                            | `show`, `start`, `status`, `close`, `reopen`, `delete`, `dep` (from), `undep` (from), `link` (either), `unlink` (from), `add-note`, `update`. |
| `ambiguous_id`          | Strict-resolved partial id matched >1 ticket.                                                   | `candidates: string[]`       | Same set as `not_found` plus `dep tree`.                                                                                                  |
| `cycle`                 | `dep <from> <to>` would create a cycle.                                                         | `cycle: string[]` (the path) | `dep`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `has_incoming_refs`     | `delete` target is referenced by another ticket through `:parent` / `:deps` / `:links`.         | `referrers: {id, field}[]`   | `delete` without `--cascade`. Drop the refs first (`undep`, `unlink`, `update --parent ""`) or re-run with `--cascade`.                    |
| `invalid_argument`      | Validation failure on a flag value or flag combination.                                         | —                            | `info --json`, `check --json` (any parse error); `update --json` (conflicting body flags); `close` / `status` / `update` (`--force` with a blank `--summary` while a gate fires on a terminal target). Other commands keep argument-parse errors on stderr — see below. |
| `acceptance_incomplete` | Active→terminal transition with at least one frontmatter `:acceptance` entry unchecked.         | `open_acceptance: {title}[]` | `close`, `status` (terminal target), `update --status <terminal>`.                                                                        |
| `open_children`         | Start or close of a ticket with a child in a non-terminal status.                               | `open_children: string[]`    | `start`, `close`, `status`, `update --status`.                                                                                            |
| `already_assigned`      | `--if-unassigned` passed and the ticket already carries a non-blank `assignee`. Nothing written. | `current_assignee: string`   | `start`, `update`.                                                                                                                        |
| `no_project`            | No `.knot.edn` and no `.tickets/` discoverable from cwd.                                        | —                            | `check` (exit 2), `info` (exit 1).                                                                                                        |
| `config_invalid`        | `.knot.edn` exists but cannot be parsed or contains invalid keys.                               | —                            | `check` (exit 2), `info` (exit 1).                                                                                                        |

Argument-parsing failures (unknown flag, missing positional, out-of-range numeric) are CLI-usage errors, not data
conditions: for most commands they die on stderr with exit 1 even under `--json`, outside the envelope contract.
`info --json` and `check --json` are the two carve-outs that route them through the envelope as `invalid_argument`, for
symmetry with their other codes.

## Per-command `data` shapes

Ticket payloads share a canonical key set across every command. The *ls-shape* omits `body`; the
*single-ticket-shape* includes it.

### Canonical ticket keys

Every ticket emitted under `--json` carries at minimum:

| Key             | Type    | Notes                                                    |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | string  | `<prefix>-01<10 base32 chars>`.                          |
| `title`         | string  | May be empty for malformed tickets; never absent.        |
| `status`        | string  | Member of project `:statuses`.                           |
| `type`          | string  | Member of project `:types`.                              |
| `priority`      | integer | `0`–`4` (`0` = highest).                                 |
| `mode`          | string  | Member of project `:modes` (default `afk` / `hitl`).     |
| `created`       | string  | ISO-8601 UTC.                                            |
| `updated`       | string  | ISO-8601 UTC; bumped on every successful save.           |
| `tags`          | array   | *Vector default* — always present, possibly `[]`.        |
| `deps`          | array   | *Vector default.*                                        |
| `links`         | array   | *Vector default.*                                        |
| `external_refs` | array   | *Vector default.*                                        |

The four vector-default keys are always arrays in `--json` output even when the on-disk YAML omits them, so
`jq -r '.data[].tags[]'` works uniformly across every ticket. The default is injected only at the JSON boundary;
on-disk pruning is unchanged.

Optional keys:

- `assignee` (string).
- `closed` (string, ISO-8601) — present on tickets in a terminal status.
- `parent` (string) — id of the parent ticket.
- `acceptance` (array of `{title, done}`) — structured criteria, from frontmatter only.
- `children_total` / `children_terminal` (integer) — umbrella progress: direct children across the full corpus (live +
  archive) and the subset in a terminal status. **Present together, and only on umbrella rows** of the four listings
  and `show`, so absence doubles as the predicate — `jq 'select(has("children_total"))'` selects umbrellas. Computed,
  never written to disk.
- `cc`, `leverage`, `coupling`, `level` (integer or `null`) — the `CC` / `LEV` / `CPL` / `LVL` metrics, present on
  **every** `list` / `ready` / `blocked` row and omitted by every other command. Uniform shape: branch on `null`, never
  on key presence. `cc` is `null` for a singleton; `leverage` and `coupling` are `null` on a closed row surfaced by
  `list --status closed`; `level` is `null` on such a row and on a live deps cycle. Definitions are in `knot help list`,
  scope rules and what to do with the numbers in [`listing-filters-and-columns.md`](listing-filters-and-columns.md).
- `body` (string) — single-ticket-shape only.
- `sections` (object) — `show --json` only: the same body split by `## ` heading, keyed by the heading slugified the
  way ticket filenames are (`## User Stories` → `user-stories`), each value the raw markdown below it, untrimmed, in
  body order. Text before the first heading lands under `""` (omitted when blank); a repeated heading concatenates.

### `info` shape

```json
{
  "project":        { "knot_version": "…", "name": "…", "prefix": "kno", "config_present": true },
  "paths":          { "cwd": "…", "project_root": "…", "config_path": "…", "tickets_dir": ".tickets", "tickets_path": "…", "archive_path": "…" },
  "defaults":       { "default_assignee": "…", "effective_create_assignee": "…", "default_type": "task", "default_priority": 2, "default_mode": "hitl" },
  "allowed_values": { "statuses": [...], "active_status": "in_progress", "terminal_statuses": [...], "types": [...], "modes": [...], "afk_mode": "afk", "priority_range": { "min": 0, "max": 4 } },
  "counts":         { "live_count": N, "archive_count": M, "total_count": N + M }
}
```

`counts` is a raw filesystem listing (top-level `*.md` only, no parsing); for a health verdict use `knot check`.

### `check` shape

```json
{
  "issues": [
    { "severity": "error", "code": "dep_cycle", "ids": ["kno-01a", "kno-01b"], "message": "…" }
  ],
  "scanned": { "live": N, "archive": M }
}
```

Issues are sorted `severity` desc → `code` asc → first id asc → `message` asc, identically in JSON and text, so diffs
over time are stable. Every entry carries `severity` (`"error"` / `"warning"`), `code`, `ids`, and `message`; the enum
validators add `field` and `value`. Exactly three codes add `path` (absolute, POSIX-separated — see *Path fields*):
`terminal_outside_archive`, `frontmatter_parse_error` (which also interpolates it into `message`; read `path`, not
`message`), and `missing_required_field` when the missing field is `id`. Treat `path` as optional and branch on its
presence.

`code` is an open enum — knot may add codes without bumping `schema_version`:

| Code                       | Severity | Trigger                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Example — an error with an extra field

```sh
$ knot show kno-01abc --json    # two tickets share that prefix; exits 1
```
```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ambiguous_id",
    "message": "Ambiguous id 'kno-01abc' matches: kno-01abc111111, kno-01abc222222",
    "candidates": ["kno-01abc111111", "kno-01abc222222"]
  }
}
```

## Recipes

```sh
# Pick the highest-priority unblocked afk ticket, id only:
knot ready --json --mode afk | jq -r '.data | sort_by(.priority) | .[0].id'

# Mutate then read the post-state in one shot:
knot start <id> --json       | jq -r '.data.status'
knot close <id> --json       | jq -r '.meta.archived_to'
knot create "T" --json       | jq -r '.data.id'

# Branch on the envelope's discriminator:
out=$(knot show "$id" --json)
if echo "$out" | jq -e '.ok' >/dev/null; then
  echo "$out" | jq -r '.data.title'
else
  code=$(echo "$out" | jq -r '.error.code')
  case "$code" in
    not_found)    echo "missing"; ;;
    ambiguous_id) echo "$out" | jq -r '.error.candidates[]'; ;;
  esac
fi

# Tolerate missing dep-tree roots (data.missing branch):
knot dep tree "$id" --json |
  jq -r 'if .data.missing then "missing root: \(.data.id)" else .data | .. | objects | .id end'

# Read one body section instead of the whole ticket:
knot show "$id" --json | jq -r '.data.sections.description'

# List the open acceptance criteria of a ticket:
knot show "$id" --json | jq -r '.data.acceptance[] | select(.done | not) | .title'

# Watch the project for new integrity issues:
knot check --json | jq '.data.issues[] | select(.severity == "error")'
```
